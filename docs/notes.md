## Experience

This has been a great challenge! I've never used Elixir, Phoenix, or LiveView, it's been fun learning it and making it work! knowing rails definetly has helped, and I was able to do it much quicker, but the most challenging part for me was the LiveView, while I was able to learn how I can make a LiveView trigger with a user interaction, that's where most tutorials has stopped, until I found that I can recall the fetching every X amount of seconds (however, I still don't think this is the most effecient way, so please let me know if there are better ways!)

## what you built and what you didn't build

- I've been able to build 3 tables, the same as `fly status` give, except one extra field in the instances table (output) to give users more information on what they need!
- I've made the tables with an easy to read layout, so the users can see all of what they need!
- I implemented a LiveView that updates every 10 seconds by fetching the data from the API and updating the page with what changed (double checked that it doesn't re-render the whole page)

## what you'd improve or fix if you had more time

- I would definetly spend more time on the mobile experience, while tailwind made use tables are still readable on mobile, they can be improved!
- I would update the Intances table to always show the ID on the left, and for the rest of the columns to be scrollable, because (while I haven't used fly.io much) I'm confident that's what they would use most of the time when they find what they need in the table!

## how you'd determine if this feature is successful

- I would look into if the feature is accomplishing the goal it's supposed to do!
- Gathering feedback would help get more information about the feature
